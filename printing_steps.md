### Want to print the notes? 

Since these notes are taken on ReMarkable tablet, printing them is not so easy. Here are some steps that can be used for printing them - 


1) Go to https://avepdf.com/convert-to-one-page-pdf and convert them all into a single page
2) Download mutool
3) Run the command
```bash
mutool poster -x 1 -y 32 "filename.pdf"
```
Replace 32 by number of pages to split. ( depends on the pdf. Lot of trail and error required.

4) Go to https://online2pdf.com/en/multiple-pages-per-sheet# and place them 2 per sheet to save paper
