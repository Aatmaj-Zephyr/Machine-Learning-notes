A) 3B1B (Foundations which should have had been taught to us in 12th standard):

1) Calculus https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr 
2) Linear Algebra https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab
3) Neural networks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi

B) IIT Madras BS degree yt: https://www.youtube.com/@IITMadrasBSDegreeProgramme

C) Stat Quest (Good videos on many ML models): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw

D) NPTEL: https://nptel.ac.in/ Courses conducted by various IITs

Here are some courses you can get started with (Checked sylabus myself)

1) Mathematics for Machine Learning IIT KGP https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc24_ma61/preview
2) Essential Mathematics for Machine Learning, IIT Roorkee (may get overwhelming) https://nptel.ac.in/courses/111107137
3) Deep Learning _ Part 1(IIT Ropar) (liked that the course syllabus is gradually entering into DL topics. For maximum benifit do ony after covering all mathematics for ML and one solid ML course. Topics like PCA, advanced SVM should be known.) https://elearn.nptel.ac.in/shop/nptel/deep-learning-_-part-1iit-ropar/?v=c86ee0d9d7ed

E) Prof Ajit’s PPTs on Probability: https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/CS215_Fall2025/ (google CS215 to find past assignments and solve them)
