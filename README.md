# Machine Learning notes (Handwritten)

Contain lot of stuff in details!


If you are getting confused with so many resources and ML topics (ML is very vast) then stick to the syllabus covered in the notes and cover it from these resources. But whatever you do, try to go very deep into it.

### Other Resources for ML

1) Playlists for ML

A) 3B1B (Foundations which should have had been taught to us in 12th standard):

1) Calculus https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr 
2) Linear Algebra https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab
3) Neural networks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi

B) IIT Madras BS degree yt: https://www.youtube.com/@IITMadrasBSDegreeProgramme There are hundreds of playlists, you can see which you want to. (If you have time you can enroll for the degree program too)

C) Stat Quest (Good videos on many ML models): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw

D) NPTEL: https://nptel.ac.in/ Courses conducted by various IITs (free, may also be available on YouTube)

Here are some curated NPTEL courses you can get started with (Checked syllabus myself)

1) Mathematics for Machine Learning IIT KGP https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc24_ma61/preview
2) Essential Mathematics for Machine Learning, IIT Roorkee (may get overwhelming) https://nptel.ac.in/courses/111107137
3) Deep Learning _ Part 1(IIT Ropar) (liked that the course syllabus is gradually entering into DL topics. For maximum benefit do only after covering all mathematics for ML and one solid ML course. Topics like PCA, advanced SVM should be known.) https://elearn.nptel.ac.in/shop/nptel/deep-learning-_-part-1iit-ropar/?v=c86ee0d9d7ed


##### Resources from IIT Bombay
A) Prof. Ajit Rajawade’s PPTs on Probability (check if you know all this before starting ML) : https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/CS215_Fall2025/ (Google CS215 to find past assignments and solve them)

B) Prof Shivram's Video lectures on Reinforcement Learning: https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/teaching/old/cs747-a2020/index.html (Solve exercises and programming assignments for max benefit)

C) CDEEP Video lectures (not free) https://www.cdeep.iitb.ac.in/ 

D) CS 725 Foundations of Machine Learning video lectures by Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan (unlisted playlist) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyo3HAXSZD3zfv9O-y9DJhvrWQPscqATa
